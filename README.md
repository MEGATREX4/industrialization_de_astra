# Industrialization de Astra  

**Industrialization de Astra** bridges the gap between **Modern Industrialization**, **TechReborn**, and **Ad Astra**, providing enhanced compatibility and refined gameplay for space exploration enthusiasts.  

## Features:  
- **Cross-Mod Compatibility:** Seamless integration of **Modern Industrialization**, **TechReborn**, and **Ad Astra** mechanics.  
- **Improved Spacesuit Functionality:** Modern Industrialization and TechReborn armor components now work cohesively with Ad Astra's oxygen and environmental systems.  
- **Dynamic Energy Usage:** Adjusted energy consumption for armor, scaling with exposure to hostile environments (now 1000 energy per second in adverse conditions).  
- **Balanced Gameplay:** Only the **Quantum Chestplate** from Modern Industrialization provides passive environmental protection, while other armor pieces act as part of a functional spacesuit.
